        <rdfs:description>Funding received from an institute of higher education. This type of funding often has a strong research component.</rdfs:description>
        <rdfs:provocation>How do the universities&apos; funding incentives try to influence the direction of the research?  What is the impact of institutionalised funding arrangements on the production of scientific knowledge, i.e., on research practices and the knowledge produced by these practices? (Gläser &amp; Velarde, 2018)</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>Funding regimes directly impact how a research problem is framed. This link has been noted in the existing literature, although sporadically. A relational ethical framework enables researchers/users of research-led AI systems to critically reflect and openly debate how funding regimes influenced their research design, how existing funding systems hope to extract economic value from &quot;useful knowledge&quot;, and an efficient AI system. Do they endorse this influence? If not, how do they find ways to work around it? For instance,  &quot;A second, related trend is that research funding is increasingly used as a means to exercise authority over the production of scientific knowledge (Whitley et al. 2010). Policymakers and funding agencies attempt to influence the conduct and content of research through the modification of funding arrangements: They try to exercise control over the direction of research by incorporating, for instance, public policy goals in funding programmes (Furman et al. 2012), introducing incentives to collaborate with industry and to commercialise funding (Swan et al. 2010), and creating mission-based research organisations (Cruz-Castro et al. 2012)&quot; (Gläser &amp; Velarde, 2018).  Also, it&apos;s important to note that &quot;recently, especially in countries such as in the USA, the United Kingdom and Australia, market forces and government simulated market actions (via performance-based funding systems) have significantly influenced the behaviour of universities (Massy, 1996)&quot;.</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>AI4SG is often conflated to mean “AI4SG = AI×SDGs” with  &quot;the assumption that “SDGs offer clear, well defined and shareable boundaries to identify positively what is socially good AI” and that “SDGs are internationally agreed on goals for development and have begun informing relevant policies worldwide, so they raise fewer questions about relativity and cultural dependency of values” [25:112]. Such framing has some glaring shortcomings that Cowls et al. choose to ignore. UN SDGs, like most United Nations consensus exercises, are not legally binding nor represent goals and principles that political groups intra-nationally or trans-nationally agree upon. Secondly, SDGs, as Telleria and Garcia-Arias [95:15] argue, is an “empty signifier that keeps disparate and even contradictory demands united”. It does this by constructing “a fantasmatic explanation of international development and sustainability issues that conceals the antagonistic dimension of social, political and economic issues” [95:15]. In a later special issue introduction edited by Cowls, Cowls notes contrary to such a straightforward and simple solution that “The contributions make clear that neither ‘AI’ nor ‘social good’ should be thought of as uncontested or incontestable terms, and we should remain wary of the twin dangers of unjustified hype and unseen harm arising from the continued growth of interest in, and application of, AI” [24:54].&quot; ( Arora &amp; Sarkar, 2023)</rdfs:references>

In other words, they are likely to use behaviororiented mechanisms to control the entrepreneur after investing. Many angel investors, unlike VCs, want to be informed about the daily operation of the venture and to work with the entrepreneur closely,such as visiting the venture or conducting recurring meetings with entrepreneurs (Landstro¨m 1998; Prowse 1998; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000; Wright and Robbie 1998). Many angel investors also consider themselves co-entrepreneurs of the invested ventures and act like an entrepreneur (Landstro¨m 1998).

Development of AI systems often feteshize scale &quot;when scale is considered to exist independently of the social or natural relations and processes which create it&quot;. Thus, to scale up an AI system is often presented as a marker of success while ignoring the ethico-political consequences of the same. Though it should be noted that there&apos;s not yet enough work on this aspect of AI systems and how they rescale the world. It might be worthwhile to remember that an &quot;understanding the world as scaled provides us with a sense of size (as when “the local” is seen as smaller than “the global”), of power relationships (as when “the global” is thought to be undermining the influence of other scales such as “the national” and “the local”), and, often, of hierarchy (as when we consider the global scale more important than scales such as the national)...&quot; (Herod 2011).</rdfs:references>

This is not to say that art should not ever attempt to do the latter, only that artists themselves could perhaps curb somewhat their own exuberant beliefs and pronouncements. The efficacy of art that engages with AI lies perhaps first and foremost in its ability to redraft the conceptual and discursive boundaries of human perception, human value and human cultural practice while drawing us as its human recipients into the recognition of our becoming (with) machines. such art can also make our human intelligence look inherently artificial--&quot; (Zylinska, 2020)</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...The first type of bias in the typology that I propose is purely technical bias, which I define quite broadly so that it includes any kind of technical or conceptual mismeasurement and misconception. A deviation exists here between what one wants to depict or measure and what is depicted or measured. However, this deviation is not based on an underlying structural inequality. The second type of data bias I call socio-technical bias. In this case there is a discrepancy between what is to be represented and what is being represented, and this discrepancy is a direct result of structural inequalities. This includes cases where disadvantaged groups are less visible, overly visible or wrongly depicted because of the way data is produced. Several cases of data bias have been discussed in the media and beyond, as in Angwin et al. (2016) and Criado-Perez (2019). The third type is societal bias. The crucial aspect here is that societal bias is not a deviation of the datafication of a phenomenon from reality—acknowledging that reality is, obviously, a highly contested concept that always follows a normative decision. According to the proposed typology, societal bias arises when structural inequalities are reflected in the respective data, albeit correctly. The underlying data of an algorithmic system depicts—in a correct way—that society structurally discriminates against certain groups...&quot; (Lopez, 2021).</rdfs:references>

On the one hand, to minimize credit rationing (Stiglitz &amp; Weiss, 1981) market participants must (to some degree) indulge the fiction that there exists a neutral metric capable of accurately representing the risk of lending to particular persons (i.e. credit score). On the other hand, credit score, as we will see, has many blind spots, biases (e.g. home-rental payments are not reported, but mortgage payments are), and ‘off-label’ (ab)uses (see Rona-Tas, 2017).

The design, deployment, and use of new technologies can have lasting effects on society, setting us on paths that in many cases are difficult to depart from or reverse.

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Indeed, the links between feminist theory and participatory/co-design processes have been well acknowledged and outlined extensively in the field.
However, recent articles have also demonstrated that co-design in the public sector is vulnerable to co-option (e.g. Blomkamp, 2018). As one countermeasure, there are calls for co-design practitioners to be more reflexive about how they enact design methods and attune to the relational aspects of participatory processes (e.g. Light &amp; Akama, 2012). Rather than outlining what feminist co-design practitioners should be doing (in terms of frameworks or universal principles)&quot; it is important to explore &quot;how feminist co-design practice unfolds and develops across applied project situations...&quot;(Korsmeyer, 2022).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...In 2016, the first Global Summit on Community Philanthropy marked an important moment in the emergence of a field. With it emerged the campaigning hashtag, #ShiftThePower. The summit, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, brought together some 350 people from more than 60 different countries.Footnote2 Its aim was not only to recognise and celebrate a growing global community philanthropy movement, but also to invite a broader range of people and organisations working in different parts of the development system to join forces and work together towards a new paradigm of people-led development. The past decade has seen the global community philanthropy movement become more visible, vocal, and organised (see Gilbert Citation2018; Hodgson and Knight Citation2016; Hodgson and Pond Citation2018). It includes new kinds of organisations and networks that have surfaced from the ground up, which all emphasise the role of local community resources in challenging conventional power dynamics and in producing qualitatively different outcomes. While money is important in community philanthropy, it is not central: instead, value is placed on generosity, trust, and solidarity, and on numbers and quality of relationships between people, communities, and institutions.
This article explores the emerging role and power of community philanthropy as a source of both alternative practice which seeks to activate and unlock community energies and assets, and as a rebuke of top-down mainstream development approaches. It assesses its potential to help shape broader efforts to move towards a more equitable and locally rooted system for people-led development...&quot; (Hodgson, 2020).&quot;</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>...&quot;Concerns about ‘ethicswashing’, ‘ethics-shopping’ and ‘ethics theater’ are repeatedly validated by examples of companies seeking to water down research that brings scrutiny to inherent harms rooted in AI business models and corporate power consolidation. These concerning dynamics occur against the backdrop of the growing lobbying power of the tech sector, as well as increased neoliberalization that sees government and independent sources of funding for academic research reduced and supplanted by industry funding. The growing role of such corporate funding with a direct interest in business-friendly results is distinctly visible in academic research on AI ethics. This worrisome dynamic brings up a number of issues about what it means to do research into the ethics of AI technologies. It raises questions about who ‘owns’ AI ethics, and by extension: who is responsible for maintaining ethical standards in academic research? Similarly, the role of private industry in research funding raises questions about the subtle and pernicious ways in which corporations exert pressure over academic work, even when funding is formally described as ‘no strings attached’. Last but not least, the changing landscape of academic funding leads to novel challenges regarding the impact of industry influence on the research agendas, as well as the career trajectories, of the next generation of academics, like the authors of this contribution...&quot; (Cath &amp; Keyes, 2022) (as well as the developers of this tool).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>Critical Discourse Analysis studies language is association with its socio-political practices. &quot;...Critical approaches, however, go further and treat social practices, not just in terms of social relationships, but also in terms of their implications for things like status, solidarity, the distribution of social goods, and power (e.g., how language in a job interview functions as a gate-keeping device, allowing some sorts of people access and denying it to others). In fact, critical discourse analysis argues that language-in-use is always part and parcel of, and partially constitutive of, specific social practices, and that social practices always have implications for inherently political things&quot;(Gee, 2011).  This method can &quot;provide insight into the social meanings ascribed to AI in the texts...  For example, AI was variously associated with change at speed and scale through terminology such as ‘unprecedented’, ‘radical’, ‘transformation’ and ‘revolution’. Some of these change-associated meanings were dystopian in tone, for example, an ‘unleashed’ phenomenon. Other texts were utopian, constructing AI as ‘generative’ and a ‘solution’. We noticed how this examination of situated meanings intersected with recurrent dualisms, in this instance utopian and dystopian accounts, which persisted across all facets of the analysis...&quot; (Bearman et al., 2023).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:provocation>Why did the project choose crowdfunding to fund its AI system for social good?</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Crowdfunding can be considered both as an ethical solution to old problems and as a source for new ethical challenges to be addressed. The very concept of crowdfunding, at its core, represents a solution to traditional barriers of access to finance, which resonates well with the utilitarian ethos of reform and social improvement. Similarly, crowdfunding presents an answer to growing scepticism towards, and disillusionment with, traditional financial institutions, which have triggered and overseen cycles of economic booms and busts in recent decades. In this view, anyone with access to internet can potentially raise funds for a project of their choice from anyone else with access to internet. This implies greater democratization in the use and allocation of financial resources, as well as greater say of the public in its choices of future consumption, provisioning of public goods, and the free promotion of ideas....On the other hand, some also view crowdfunding as a source of new ethical problems. Such view challenges the assumption that the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ is coming up with optimal solutions. Here some critics warn about the ‘madness of the crowd’, the ‘tyranny of the majority’, and unintentional legitimization of institutional failures. First, the concerns with the madness of the crowd, involve situations where groups of people can be collectively misguided and even illogical and delusional (Mackay 2006). Such situations are exacerbated by herding behaviours and information cascades, where later decision making is based on inferences from earlier decision making by others ...&quot; (Shneor et al., 2020).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...In August 2016, Facebook fired the team who had been curating its “Trending Topics” section and replaced them with an algorithm that would automatically recognize and promote popular topics. The move came after months of controversy about Facebook’s handling of Trending Topics, including charges of political bias on the part of the editors managing the feature. About 2 days later, however, “Facebook’s foray into automated news went from messy to disastrous” (Oremus, 2016). For at least 8 hours on August 28, Trending Topics highlighted a popular—but erroneous—article claiming that then-Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly had been fired from the cable TV network because she had endorsed Hillary Clinton for U.S. president. Although Facebook still employed a few human editors who were supposed to watch for algorithmically surfaced hoaxes and fake news, they failed to recognize that the source of this particular article (the website endingthefed.com) was neither a reputable mainstream outlet nor a popular conservative site. Instead, “the Trending review team accepted it thinking it was a real-world topic” (Gunaratna, 2016). In the aftermath, the question of responsibility arose: “Even if algorithms are now running the show, is Facebook legally responsible for what happened . . . ?” (R. Meyer, 2016). In other words, had Facebook’s Trending Topics algorithm defamed Megyn Kelly? Or, more generally, can a bot commit libel?...What happens when automated content libels someone, whether because of erroneous data, poorly programmed algorithms, or some combination that produces not just false information but particularly damaging, reputation-harming material?...&quot; (Lewis et al., 2019).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:provocation>How did the consensus around  &apos;good&apos; choice concerning an AI system emerge and against what alternatives?</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>AI research at the moment is fairly limited. Qualitative research methods such as deliberative forums are rarely used to map socio-political imaginaries of AI. However, if used creatively, the method can help discuss issues of democracy and political proper surrounding an AI system. &quot;...Democratic forums come from a tradition that draws on the development of interest in more participative and discursive models of democracy (Mouffe, 2010), and provide five key strengths. Observation of discussion in forums allows us to: (i) explore how people understand issues and link together their ideas about different aspects of the welfare state; this includes: (ii) the identification of particular issues as priorities; and (iii) the justification of those priorities in relation to ideas about how different aspects of the welfare world impact on each other; forums also allow us to: (iv) see how people respond to information from different sources, and what information carries the most weight with different groups; and (v) to explore the way group interaction influences discussion and final conclusions over a more extended period of time than is possible in focus groups (Wakeford, 2007)...&quot; (Taylor‐Gooby et al., 2018). &quot;...but what is missing in all of them - as in the deliberative approach - is a proper reflection on the moment of &apos;decision&apos; which characterizes the field of politics. This has serious consequences, since it is precisely those decisions - which are always taken in an undecidable terrain - which structure hegemonic relations. They entail an element of force and violence that can never be eliminated and cannot be adequately apprehended through the sole language of ethics or morality. We need a reflection of the political proper...&quot; (Mouffe, 2000).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Another, more subtle reason pertains to AI&apos;s ambiguous location between science and engineering. A scientific theory makes truth-claims about the preexisting universe, and so it is generally considered legitimate to criticize someone else&apos;s theory on grounds of methodological weakness, fallacious reasoning, lack of fit with the evidence, or compatibility of the evidence with other theories. Engineering design methods, on the other hand, make claims in the context of practical problems, and so the legitimate criticisms relate solely to issues of utility. AI projects are sometimes scientific in intention, sometimes engineering, and sometimes they shift subliminally from one to the other. AI people often make substantive claims about knowledge or learning or language, and yet many of them will respond with indignation to arguments that their projects fundamentally misconstrue the nature of these phenomena; in most cases (the primary exception being Newell and Simon&apos;s research group at Carnegie-Mellon University) they will argue not that the claims against their work are empirically false but that they are non sequiturs. Pressed to explain the seeming contradiction, they will generally state that their systems exhibit knowledge-as-such, say, as opposed to human knowledge in particular...The underlying problem is not mendacity but a conflict of languages: norms and discourses of engineering are applied to terms (knowledge, learning, language, and so on) whose meanings are inextricably rooted in the phenomena of human life...A final reason, which I have already discussed above, is that AI discourse makes it exceptionally difficult to conceptualize alternatives to the field&apos;s prevailing ideas. Indeed, AI does not have &quot;ideas&quot; in any sense that would be familiar from philosophy or literature or social thought; instead it has technical practices, loosely articulated intuitions about those practices, and ways of talking about the resulting artifacts that combine precision and vagueness in specific ways...In these ways, AI&apos;s construction of itself as a self-contained technical discipline, though seemingly governed by practical-minded criteria of success and failure, is actually a powerful force for intellectual conservatism. Critics will be asked, &quot;what&apos;s your alternative?&quot;, within a tacit system of discursive rules that virtually rules out alternatives from the start. All the same, I think that the very concept of &quot;alternatives&quot; is misleading, and that it is actually impossible to achieve a radical break with the existing methods of the field. This is because AI&apos;s existing language and technical practice, like any disciplinary culture, runs deeper than we are aware...&quot; (Agre, 1997).</rdfs:references>

Even though people know they’re dealing with a machine, they feel inclined to respond as if they were in the presence of a human being; perhaps they are powerless to behave otherwise. While there are many aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) that deserve the basic cautious approach of any consumer good, the anthropomorphic design aspects of robots and digital entities that we discuss present a challenge to even the canniest among us. Humans are even more prone to anthropomorphizing a robot that walks or talks than a simple appliance that is not designed to look like us, sound like us, act like us, or resemble any being that is alive, like an insect or animal. As more devices and robots are incorporated into our daily lives, dishonest anthropomorphism poses grave threats because bad actors will recognize the value of intentionally exploiting our anthropomorphic tendencies and roboticists who do not understand the power of anthropomorphism will unintentionally create products that are misaligned with consumers’ mental models of what embodied gestures mean...&quot; (Leong &amp; Selinger, 2019).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Yet the actual research into AI only took off in the 1950s, when scientists and engineers suggested that formal logic could be applied not just by humans but also by machines – and when machines were powerful enough to undertake these kinds of operations of symbolic reasoning. Much work at the time was driven by the desire to enable machines to think like humans, a criterion that later became known as the Turing Test. However, ‘by the 1980s AI researchers realized that they had neither sufficient hardware nor the knowledge to simulate everything a human can do – and the field fragmented. Instead of working towards one single human-equivalent computer intelligence, research groups splintered off to investigate specific aspects of the larger problem: speech recognition, computer vision and probabilistic inference – even chess’ (New Scientist 2017). Enthusiasm and funding slowly petered out and so by the early 1990s research in the field came to a halt in most places, marred by many disappointments and unrealised promises. Yet over the last decade we have entered what some are calling AI 2.0. The renewed interest in AI research has been accompanied by a change of tack: from what became known as Artificial General Intelligence, whose goal was to replicate the human’s mental functioning as such, to specialised, or ‘narrow’ AI, focused on performing particular tasks and solving singular problems...&quot; (Zylinska, 2020).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:provocation>How does AI rework the fundamental inequality between the learner and the learned that is at the heart of education discourse? Can human-machine entanglements help interrupt the banking concept of education.?</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>&quot;...AI chatbots are the current fascination of EdTech, a discourse Selwyn (2016) found to be full of bullshit. In his reading, the language of transformation and progress pervading EdTech springs from marketing, hype, or simply naive hope rather than 100 years of the research into what has been found to actually transform education—which is in itself very little (Selwyn 2016). There is nothing new here I am pointing to, as we have already been warned about the ‘learnification’ of education (Biesta 2009, 2015a, 2015b; Bayne 2015a), when it is written in languages where teachers are replaced by robots (Selwyn 2019). This is evident in the AI in education research literature where teachers have been found to be conspicuous by their absence (Zawacki-Richter et al. 2019). Although an alternative prediction is that we will have more human teachers in the classroom of the future, not less, and they will be needed to orchestrate sophisticated AI ensembles (Dillenbourg 2016)....So will robots replace or generate teachers? Will we escape the human machine distinction altogether and reinvent ourselves as cyborgs and teacherbots, enacting entangled pedagogies of the postdigital? (Haraway 1985/1991; Bayne 2015b; Fawns 2022)....The conversation will go on and on and in many directions&quot; (Costello, 2023) . There is also utility in Rancière’s (1991) committed emphasis for the need to start from a premise of equality of intelligence, ...Or, to put it in the words of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire (1970), of the need to avoid a ‘banking concept of education’, whereby ‘knowledge is a gift bestowed by those who consider themselves knowledgeable upon those whom they consider to know nothing’...

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Despite this intuition, there remains an inconsistency in the debate between the socio-economic importance of power and the level of conceptual clarity regarding what power is...Domination, as understood by the neo-republican framework, occurs when one is subjected to a superior and unaccountable power (Pettit 1997)...My argument is as follows: first, the moral wrong of domination requires both superior and unaccountable power (Pettit 1997). Second, following the work of Cristiano Castelfranchi (2003), there is a power-dependence relation between those who shape a system (i.e., developers and users) and those affected by a system (i.e., end-users). So how does Castelfranchi’s framework relate to ML systems? Here, I argue that the influence of developers and users on an ML system produces a dependence asymmetry between those who develop and use the system and the end users. Given that (1) the developers and users of systems have an influence on the system’s behaviour, and (2) the system has an effect on the end-users, the end-users depend to some extent on the developers and users to design and deploy the system in such a way that it meets the end-users needs, upholds their rights, and respects democratic values like privacy, freedom, and autonomy. This dependence then, following Castelfranchi, automatically  entails that the developers and users have some ‘power-over’ the system’s end-users...&quot; (Maas, 2022).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;When I teach this material to students, I warn them that the subject does not exist. Among all nonexistent subjects, in fact, equity occupies a distinguished position because it fails to exist in several different ways. The arguments against existence take three different forms. The first is that equity is merely a word that hypocritical people use to cloak self-interest. It has no intrinsic meaning and therefore fails to exist. The second argument is that, even if equity does exist in some notional sense, it is so hopelessly subjective that it cannot be analyzed scientifically. Thus it fails to exist in an objective sense. The third argument is that, even granting that equity might not be entirely subjective, there is no sensible theory about it, and certainly none that is compatible with modern welfare economics. In short, it fails to exist in an academic sense. I hasten to add that equity, or at least a close relative, is very much alive and occupies a prominent place in moral philosophy. For philosophers, however, the central problem is to define what we mean by a just social order. Equity in this sense is concerned with the proper distribution of resources, rights, duties, opportunities, and obligations in society at large.&quot; (Young, 1995).</rdfs:references>

&quot;The fast-moving wave of critique that defined the ‘‘tech lash’’ is now being subsumed by an even larger wave of what Elettra Bietti calls ‘‘ethics bashing.’’ Where the tech lash centered on exposing the bad behavior of some of the world’s largest tech corporations, this next wave addresses the rise of ‘ethics’ as a new industrial agenda, focusing on actions such as the establishment of AI ethics boards, hiring AI ethics teams, and funding AI ethics research. Critics have fairly interpreted these actions as efforts to instrumentalize ethics, to reduce it to another form of industrial capital, or to co-opt and capture researchers as part of efforts to control public narratives...&quot; (Economies of Virtue – The Circulation of ‘Ethics’ in AI, 2022)</rdfs:references>

This phenomenon is known as ethics dumping: the export of harms and unethical research practices by companies to marginalised and vulnerable populations or to low- and middle-income countries, and which often aligns “with the old fault lines of colonialism” (Schroeder et al. 2018).&quot;&quot; (Mohamed et al., 2020) &quot;&quot;In Latin America, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, Cisco, Google are commonly involved in AI

There is now an enormous amount of work under the rubric of ‘AI ethics.’ To be fair, some of the research is useful and nuanced, especially in the humanities and social sciences. But the majority of well-funded work on ‘ethical AI’ is aligned with the tech lobby’s agenda: to voluntarily or moderately adjust, rather than legally restrict, the deployment of controversial technologies.

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...The counterpoint to ethics dumping is ethics shirking: what is not done to protect people when harms emerge beyond what is demanded from legal or regulatory frameworks (Floridi 2019). As an example, Cambridge Analytica (CA) elected to beta-test and develop algorithmic tools for the 2017 Kenyan and 2015 Nigerian elections, with the intention to later deploy these tools in US and UK elections. Kenya and Nigeria were chosen in part due to the weaker data protection laws compared to CA’s base of operations in the United Kingdom—a clear example of ethics dumping. These systems were later found to have actively interfered in electoral processes and worked against social cohesion (Nyabola 2018). A critical decolonial approach would, for example, lead us to ask early on why the transgression of democratic processes by companies such as CA only gained international attention and mobilisation after beginning to affect Western democratic nations... To do so, we can draw from existing analysis of ICT for Development, which are often based on historical analysis and decolonial critique (Irani et al. 2010; Toyama 2015). These critiques highlight concerns of dependency, dispossession or ethics dumping and shirking, as discussed earlier (Schroeder et al. 2018). Such critiques take renewed form as AI is put forward as a needed tool for social development. Where a root cause of failure of developmental projects lies in default attitudes of paternalism, technological solutionism and predatory inclusion...&quot; (Mohamed et al., 2020)</rdfs:references>

Thus, is a world in which ethics-washing and ethics-shopping are becoming increasingly common, it is important to have common criteria based on which the quality of ethical and human rights commitments made can be evaluated.

        <rdfs:description>A redefinition of care ethics that asks how ethical aspirations to ‘do good’ are entangled in politically charged care practices that are ‘ambivalent, contextual, and relational’ (Martin et al. 2015: 631) and can be fraught with histories of sexism, racism, capitalism and colonialism (Murphy 2015).</rdfs:description>
        <rdfs:references>&quot;...We take as a point of departure Puig de la Bellacasa’s ‘speculative ethics’ (2011, 2017), which puts constructivist accounts of science, technology and society (STS) into play with Joan Tronto’s political theory on the ethics of care (Tronto 1993)...Among other things, Bellacasa’s work offers a “commitment to generating a ‘speculative’ critique which offers possible alternatives for living a ‘good’ life. Rather than a moral stance or invocation for motherly love, ‘care’ is thus deployed as ‘an analytic or provocation’ (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 7)”...Contrary to those who have interpreted Tronto’s care ethics as normative (e.g. Pols 2015), Puig de la Bellacasa asserts that Tronto’s work offers ‘a vision of caring [that] presupposes heterogeneity as the ontological ground on which everything humans relate with exists … Its ontological import gives to care the peculiar significance of being a nonnormative necessity’ (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 70). Weaving Tronto’s care ethics together with constructivist accounts of technoscience, Puig de la Bellacasa’s approach has led to a lineage of feminist scholarship in science and technology studies (STS) which foregrounds the ‘ethico-political’ practices of care in technoscience in a wide range of settings (Lindén and Lydahl 2021). These ‘Critical Care’ studies of technology design and use illustrate how ethics often operate in tension with justice — how ethical aspirations to ‘do good’ are entangled in politically charged care practices that are ‘ambivalent, contextual, and relational’ (Martin et al. 2015: 631) and can be fraught with histories of sexism, racism, capitalism and colonialism ...&quot;(Henry &amp; Oliver, 2022)</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...This eccentric form of moral thinking recognizes that the real challenge for ethics is not figuring out a way to include others, but to identify and confront the systemic exclusions of any and all efforts at inclusion as a significant and fundamental aspect of moral thinking itself. What we need to do in the face of the machine, therefore, is not to try to formulate more inclusive forms of moral theory that can account for and incorporate these others, but to recognize the symptom as such and allow it to question the entire history of ethics and its necessary and unavoidable exclusions. This is precisely that kind of thinking that Friedrich Nietzsche (1966) had called “the philosophy of the future,” not only because the symptom of ethics, like the machine, appears to threaten us from the future but because it points in the direction of a kind of thinking that is situated beyond (the very system of) good and evil. This means that the challenge presented to us by the machine is not just a matter of applied ethics; it invites and entrains us to rethink the entire modus operandi of moral philosophy all the way down. This is the task for thinking that is seen in the face or the faceplate of the machine...&quot; (Gunkel, 2022).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Despite the recent resurgence of explanation and interpretability in AI, most of the research and practice in this area seems to use the researchers&apos; intuitions of what constitutes a ‘good’ explanation. Miller et al. [132] shows in a small sample that research in explainable AI typically does not cite or build on frameworks of explanation from social science. They argue that this could lead to failure. The very experts who understand decision-making models the best are not in the right position to judge the usefulness of explanations to lay users — a phenomenon that Miller et al. refer to (paraphrasing Cooper [132], [31]) as “the inmates running the asylum”. Therefore, a strong understanding of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations seems almost essential...&quot; (Miller, 2019). 
&quot;The detective, questioning a suspect about a murder, asks the suspect, Why did he die? The suspect tentatively suggests, Well, everyone has to go sometime, sir. Here, the suspect is dodging the detective&apos;s &quot;real&quot; question. The effect of such differing spaces of alternatives is not always a joke; what aspect of a given state of affairs we take to be problematic radically
affects the success or failure of potential explanations. For an explanation to be successful, it must speak to the question at hand, whether explicit or implicit, or else we will have failures of fit...What we need, therefore, is some way of representing what is really getting explained in a given explanation, and what is not&quot;. Explanataroy frames are shifting. &quot;Perhaps the most interesting cases of changes in explanatory frames are ones in which there is a shift in the nature of the question being asked. Explanations are sometimes answers to explicit questions. Why is the sky blue? Why do metals expand when heated?4 But often there is no explicit question at hand, and in those cases it can be very instructive to perform a kind of diagnostic inference and ask what question the explanation is really answering...&quot; (Garfinkel, 1981). 

This is more so the case with emerging socio-technical objects such as AI...&quot;.</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...The public sector&apos;s predicament [concerning the widespread adoption of AI] is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate (Lodge &amp; Mennicken, 2017). The challenge stems from algorithms&apos; intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments: vast computing power - exceeding human cognitive capabilities; ‘learning’ - autonomous knowledge creation happening without proper supervision; profiling - categorizing traits and behaviours; and nudging - incentivizing compliance - these all create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector intensify, it is important to examine how machine learning and bureaucracy have both “become generalisable modes of rational ordering based on abstraction and deriving authority from claims to neutrality and objectivity” (McQuillan, 2019). It is with that in mind, that we shall consider our research question: how the use of AI in the public sector can be intensifying existing power asymmetries and governance practices?...&quot; (Kuziemski &amp; Misuraca, 2020)</rdfs:references>

In the US, government research grants have often come from progammatic, mission-oriented agencies charged with achieving very practical goals. These pragmatic considerations may lead agencies to insist on the production
of immediately useful knowledge at the expense of traditional academic scholarship... The independence of funding decisions from academic output highlights the fact that much university research funding goes to researchers who produce results of moderate academic value but of perhaps high value to sponsors. These researchers occupy a middle ground between corporate researchers and the traditional view of the Ivory Tower...&quot; (Goldfarb, 2008).&quot;</rdfs:references>

Fittingly, these scholars spend considerable time thinking through what is to be done to mitigate this sectarianism, including platform interventions to encourage more thoughtful deliberation, crowdsourcing false and hyperpartisan content, and algorithmic interventions to deemphasize supposedly harmful content in people’s feeds. This article—and many more—reveals how polarization and platforms consume the field’s imaginary when diagnosing our contemporary democratic ills and provides a reliable go-to for both blame and intervention...&quot; (Kreiss &amp; McGregor, 2023).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Algorithms oppress (Noble, 2018); algorithms are violent (Safransky, 2020); algorithms can be ‘mad’, ‘aberrant’ and ‘unreasonable’ (Amoore, 2020); algorithms work, algorithms anticipate, assess risk, algorithms have social power (Beer, 2017); algorithms match us – to partners, services, properties – algorithms do many things. These busy algorithms have not escaped the attention of geographers who have looked at both the pernicious effects of algorithmic acts and to some extent the potential benefits they may also bring. Much of this work on algorithms has emerged as part of a critical ‘digital turn’ in geography (Ash et al., 2018). The recognition that technologies, software and algorithms do ‘work’ in the world is evident across the discipline – from mediating and governing cities to producing space (Kitchin and Dodge, 2011) to influencing markets (Fourcade and Healy, 2017), nature (McLean, 2020; Adams, 2019), housing (Fields, 2019) and the everyday, algorithms are working for, with and against us. Despite this work, Del Casino et al. (2020: 606) argue that less attention has been paid to thinking through ‘the reimagination of human-nonhuman relations, subjectivities, and potentialities that come to be possible’ in algorithmic life (Del Casino et al., 2020: 606). Indeed, it is undeniable that geographers have predominantly paid attention to the more harmful effects of algorithms, producing necessary and important critiques, yet in doing so overlooking the many generative and exciting possibilities of algorithms, such as their potential for care, or alternative ways of seeing...&quot; (Maalsen, 2023).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Most of the existing work on the power or effect of algorithms is broadly considered with their harmful implications. Onuoha (2018) posits ‘algorithmic violence’ as term that reflects digital and data-driven inequity. It is ‘the violence that an algorithm or automated decision-making system inflicts by preventing people from meeting their basic needs. It results from and is amplified by exploitative social, political, and economic systems, but can also be intimately connected to spatially and physically borne effects’ (Onuoha, 2018). This follows a line of thought put forward by feminist scholars on the discriminating nature of algorithms, which code in the existing prejudices of the social, economic, racial and political structures within which they are produced (Noble, 2018; Eubanks, 2017)....The underlying basis of these arguments is that algorithms treat people unequally because of the bias that is coded into them via the individual and institutional ideologies behind them. Because computer programming and technology is a middle-class male dominated profession, then the algorithms they produce ‘see’ the world in similar ways and thus perpetuate the same discriminatory practices, further amplified by the entanglement of technology with economies and governance. Understanding algorithmic power and harm therefore requires acknowledging the uneven power relations in which they are produced and which they in turn perpetuate&quot; (Maalsen, 2023). One could &quot;distinguish between two broad varieties of responses to algorithmic harms: how Big Tech-the chief actor of algorithmic harms-has quickly adopted a stance of solidarity to resist them; and refusals that emerge from beyond Big Tech and raise philosophical provocations about what it means to construct life outside the ambit of Big Tech-architected harms and mitigations...&quot;(Ganesh &amp; Moss, 2022).

However, the idea of centering the disproportionally impacted goes further than human-centered or participatory design as broadly construed. While the latter approaches often neglect those at the margins and shy away from power asymmetries and structural inequalities that permeate the social world, and “mirror individualism and capitalism by catering to consumer&apos;s purchasing power at the expense of obscuring the hidden labor that is necessary for creating such system” for the former, acknowledging these deeply ingrained structural hierarchies and hidden labor is a central starting point&quot;(Birhane, 2021).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;... there is a need for an interdisciplinary mode of theorising ‘intelligence’ as relational and affective in ways that can accommodate the fragmentation of both conceptual and material boundaries between human and AI, and human and machine. Our aim in investigating these sociological, philosophical and ethical questions is primarily to explore the relationship between affect, relationality and ‘intelligence,’ the intersection and integration of ‘human’ and ‘artificial’ intelligence, through an examination of how AI is used across different dimensions of intelligence... how ‘intelligence’ is ultimately conveyed, understood and (technologically or algorithmically) configured in practice through emerging relationships that go beyond the conceptual divisions between humans and machines, and humans vis-à-vis artificial intelligence-based technologies...AI has been described as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines” McCarthy (2007: 2) or “the activity devoted to making machines intelligent” (Nilsson 2009: 13). Such definitions raise questions around what ‘intelligence’ itself entails. The word implies a philosophical and cultural fascination with intelligence as a characteristic capacity that seemingly confers on humans a special place among other life forms. The notion of ‘artificial intelligence’ suggests that intelligence can be simulated through technological means, and yet that such simulated intelligence remains different from the ‘natural’ or, perhaps, ‘real’ intelligence exhibited by humans...&quot; (De Togni et al., 2021).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:provocation>What is the relationship between justice and code(law)? Is justice possible without law? Can justice be coded?</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>&quot;...justice can become a verb. It then designates a way of being, of shining forth, of radiating, and of acting, a way of doing things, most often with words, with the performative force of a speech act: to justice. To justice would be to produce justice, cause it to prevail, make it come about, as an event, but without instrumentalizing it in a transitivefashion,without objectifying it, but rather making it proceed from itself even as one keeps it close itself, to what one is, namely just, closest to what one thinks, says, does, shows, and manifests. The one who thus justices does not refer in the first or the last place to the calculable rules and norms of law. He is just by essence, just as he breathes. He does what is just, he accomplishes the just in a spontaneous manner&quot; (Derrida, 2005). &quot;Some people work seriously on a kind of robotisation of justice: eventually, codes are only algorithms and judges need to follow them, so why not augmenting the impartiality, the speed and the efficiency in automatising justice decisions? It is already taking place. For instance, there are systems of recommendations in relation to early release for defendants or to evaluate risks of second offence. These are built on behavioural models founded on the analysis of Big Data, using profiles of typical second offenders. It is of course extremely tempting to follow such systems of recommendations for a judge or for someone who has to decide whether to keep someone in prison or to release him or her. If we deviate from these recommendations, if we decide against the machine’s position, we take personally the responsibility of a possible second offence. Perhaps there is some progress made on a specific notion of objectivity, but we can also lose something in the understanding of justice (that is particularly important in my opinion) as an undecidable horizon...&quot; (Rouvroy &amp; Stiegler, 2016).</rdfs:references>

A differentiation on the basis of an unemployed person’s gender entry with potentially harmful effects, on the other hand, is viewed as undesirable, because the applicable Austrian anti-discrimination law protects the feature gender. Algorithmic systems are, thus, viewed as being situated in their respective national legal context and context of use...Another issue with legal frameworks is that they are always embedded in their national (or supra-national) context. Accordingly, applying the typology proposed in this paper always follows the national legal context in which the algorithmic system in question operates. Algorithmic systems and their potentially harmful effects on vulnerable individuals and groups have to be viewed as situated in their context of use—and this situatedness is as dynamic and ever-changing as legal regulations can be. In short, linking the bias typology to legal anti-discrimination regulations entails its own set of invisibilities...&quot;(Lopez, 2021).</rdfs:references>

matters of fact begin to look different, to render a different sound, they start to move in all directions, they overflow their boundaries, they include a complete set of new actors, they reveal the fragile envelopes in which they are housed. Instead of “being there whether you like it or not” they still have to be there, yes (this is one of the huge differences), they have to be liked, appreciated, tasted, experimented upon, mounted, prepared, put to the test. It is the same world, and yet, everything looks different. Matters of fact were indisputable, obstinate, simply there; matters of concern are disputable, and their obstinacy seems to be of an entirely different sort: they move, they carry you away, and, yes, they too matter...&quot; (Latour, 2014).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...The emergent, unpredictable, non-linear and dynamic nature of materialist enactments is again emphasised in this literature, which builds on the work of many social theorists, including Spinoza, Foucault, Deleuze, Merleau-Ponty, Latour and Bourdieu. This approach also refuses a dualistic approach to agency and matter and focuses attention on the ways in which actors are inextricably entangled, together generating vitality (Bennett, 2004, 2010; Coole, 2013). Bennett’s concept of ‘thing-power’, or ‘the curious ability of inanimate things to animate, to act, to product effects dramatic and subtle’ (2004: 351) is important in emphasising the vibrant agential capacities of human–nonhuman assemblages. Thing-power is a dynamic flow of energy between and with the components of assemblages. Bennett argues that the concept of thing-power emphasises the intimacy of humans and nonhumans, the ways that they are so closely intertwined in the moments when ‘human being and thinghood overlap’ (2004: 349). She further elaborates that thing-power is not located in one specific object alone, but rather is a function of the grouping of different things in an assemblage, each operating in conjunction with the others (including humans) (Bennett, 2004: 354)...&quot; (Lupton, 2018). This thing power can always pose new risks and new potentialities.</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;What would happen if we took discrimination with regard to data-driven politics seriously and built systems that acknowledged the fundamental fluidity of identity?  In her essay, Hito Steyerl offers a taste of what this could mean. She shows us the hardwired ideologies of a machinic vision, in which data builds the basis of our reality. However, this reality doesn’t necessarily match with the catchphrases of the data industry. Rather than a smooth operation, algorithmically enhanced pattern recognition struggles with a massive amount of real—that is, dirty—data. As Steyerl explains, algorithms must constantly fix the mess that we call life. And just like in real life, the criteria to decide what to include and exclude are intrinsically political&quot; (Apprich et al., 2018).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:provocation>Do we need a parliament of things?</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>&quot;...In the shadow of the coming catastrophe of semiocapital’s climate change and toxicity, do we need a parliament of things—a demogenesis fitting the simultaneity of soil, earth, and science (see Latour 2015)? Let’s leave aside the question of whether existence has agreed that its governance is like a human parliament. Are some things going to get more ballots, or more weight in the voting? Will we only allow those forms of entanglement that are our companion species to vote, excluding various forms of viruses, bacteria, and algae? Probably—this is the point of an antagonism defining the field of solidarity. And will the parliament of things include all things living and nonliving? Will desert sands get a vote? Or when we pass out the ballots will we predetermine what does and doesn’t have a soul, refusing the nonliving, the never-having-lived, a possibility of extending itself? Or do we decide that all things are vital? Do we work with those who say that from the perspective of anthropogenic climate change there is no difference between life and nonlife? ... But politics after anthropogenic climate change and toxicity will need to grapple with a world without autonomy or antagonists yet extraordinarily hostile to some regions of existence. The illusions of our epoch are the autonomous and antagonistic. Other illusions may be better suited. Viruses, gassings, toxins—these are the names we give to manners of appearing and spreading; tactics of diverting the energies of arrangements of existence in order to extend themselves; strategies of copying, duplicating, and lying dormant even as they continually adjust to, experiment with, and test their circumstances; maneuvers to confuse and level every difference that emerges between regions while carefully taking advantage of the minutest aspects of their differentiation...&quot; (Povinelli, 2017)</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...More broadly, one can argue that the meaning of technology is subject to an ongoing process of social negotiation. Computers are not merely ‘consumables’ like many other products. They are also symbolic goods that serve as markers of social distinction (Cawson et al. 1995)...they are seen to represent modernity, intellectual superiority and freedom from constraint. From being the preserve of geeks and nerds, they are now increasingly represented as the epitome of cool sophistication. Here, again, education plays a crucial symbolic role. Investing in computers is, so parents are told, a way of investing in your children’s future. Computers give children access to worlds of knowledge that would otherwise be denied to them; and, so it is argued, they put children themselves in control of their own learning. Education and parenting without technology thereby become at least conservative, if not downright reactionary. It is the fundamental responsibility of good parents and teachers to ‘catch up’ with the children who are in their charge—although there is considerable room for debate about whether the promises here are actually fulfilled&quot; (Buckingham et al., 2013)... &quot;Up until to date, parents have only been able to participate to a limited extent in their children&apos;s school activities. Manolev et al. (this issue) however, describe how parents may receive daily updates on their child’s behaviour via the ClassDojo platform. This platform facilitates the interaction of different user groups such as teachers, students, parents and school management and in so doing expands the space of communication between educational actors and transforms their relationships. Bradbury (this issue), reports on the changing relationships of teachers and children but also parents and children through digital assessment practices that commence in early childhood education. She reports how reception teachers experience the need to produce data as ‘detrimental to the process of building relationships with children to make them feel secure’ (p. 15). The necessity to use tablet-based assessments changed the previous interaction and ‘reduced focus on building relationships’ (ibid). Parents however, having access to these assessment data become constant observers of their child’s ‘progress...’&quot; (Jarke &amp; Breiter, 2019).</rdfs:references>

question, we address the following ongoing strands of CSCW and PD research: (1) Community-driven engagement (de-center researchers and ensure that those without institutional power drive inquiry and design); (2) Accountable positionality (begin by accounting for researcher’s privileges, roles, and
responsibilities); (3) Responsible citational practices (responsibly consider whose voices get amplified and credited); and (4) Maintaining transparency (put mechanisms in place to keep budgets, promises, and transactions open and trackable)...&quot; (D’Ignazio et al., 2020).</rdfs:references>

Peacebuilding, public health, emergency aid, human rights, and development are expressions of this tension between care and control. There is a concept that captures this tension: paternalism. Drawing on our moral intuitions, I argue that paternalism is the attempt by one actor to substitute his judgment for another actor&apos;s on the grounds that such an imposition will improve the welfare of the target actor. After discussing and defending this definition, I note how our unease with paternalism seems to grow as we scale up from the interpersonal to the international, which I argue owes to the evaporation of community and equality...&quot; (Barnett, 2015).</rdfs:references>

This underscores that the classification of personal data is dynamic. Depending on context, the same data point can be personal or non-personal and hence be subject to the Regulation or not.

Underpinning the rise of philanthrocapitalism is the idea that to do good socially, one must do well financially: public and private interest are strategically conflated and touted as intrinsically mutually compatible. I suggest that far from being a new concept, the deliberate conflation of public and private interest resonates with eighteenth-century perceptions of the moral value of capitalism: the debatable view that capitalism helps to mitigate political strife and foster cooperation among nations, promoting the public good through individual economic enrichment...&quot; (McGoey, 2012).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;..Asking, or asking for, almost anything, whether directions, help, love, money, even for the time, can be asking for trouble, so we must take a great deal of trouble with the way we ask in order to head it off...making a request may be a ‘facethreatening action’, that potentially threatens the freedom of action of one’s interlocutor. Asking anything of anyone is requesting a gift or benefit that they do not have to give... one must avoid giving the impression that one assumes any right to what one requests, while securing nevertheless one’s right to make the request. ...Asking is difficult not just because asking may seem like an aggressive imposition. For asking is an intimate act, or an act which intimates intimacy, which can be uncomfortable even where it is not aggressive....Asking any kind of question always sings, like the Mock Turtle, ‘Will you, wo’n’t you, will you, wo’n’t you, wo’n’t you join the dance?’ (Carroll 1998, 90). Requesting or enquiring are both forms of requirement: if any asking simultaneously asks about the acceptability of its asking, it also asks its subject to agree to give an answer, whatever the content of that answer might be. Asking is therefore always attended by moral, emotional and political tension. Asking is difficult because of our awareness that being asked can be what we call an imposition, in that it imposes a demand; that any ask is potentially a big ask...&quot; (Connor, 2023)</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:provocation>Is there an option to say no?</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>&quot;It is already a common critique that current forms of notifications (privacy policies and terms of services followed by binary “agree” or “disagree” buttons) used to acquire our consent in digital platforms have turned it into meaningless and nongranular ways to accept different data processing operations. But critiques from feminist scholars to the model of “notice and consent” go even deeper and question structural power asymmetries between data subjects and the controller, as well as the neoliberal individualistic approach that data protection legislations have set towards consent. For legal scholar Julie E. Cohen, to understand privacy simply as an individual right is a mistake, as she points out, “the ability to have, maintain and manage privacy depends heavily on the attributes of one’s social, material, and informational environment” (2012). In this way, privacy is not a thing or an abstract right, but an environmental condition that enables situated subjects to navigate within preexisting cultural and social matrices (Cohen, 2012, 2018)... For researcher Daniel Solove (2013), under the current approach of privacy regulation—that he would call “privacy self-management”, but is also called “privacy as control” by other scholars (Cohen, 2018)—policymakers try to provide people with a set of rights to enable them to make decisions about how to manage their data. This is an individual framing of consent, based on the assumption that we are all autonomous, free, and rational individuals with the capacity to consent, disregarding our possibility of doing so due to unequal power dynamics&quot;(Varon &amp; Peña, 2021).</rdfs:references>

What is the ground from which this prediction is being made (which material conditions, institutional settings, data sources, etc.) and what conditions of possibility does it create because of that? Who are the anticipated benefactors of the use of such tools and, importantly, who are not included in the stakeholders list? Asking these contextual questions also requires endorsing a more systemic understanding of ... care and prediction, as a complex nexus of relations that are dependent not only on strictly defined categories but also on a much broader set of factors such as quality of life, social support network, structural in/equalities, and so on. The challenge ...that we raise for practitioners is to do this with an understanding of the biases that are built into and the limitations of algorithmic decision making. On a more theoretical level, this also encourages to re‐think and expand the premises of ethical actions and decisions, particularly in the face of technological and other forms of difference...&quot; (Smith et al., 2023).</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;...Whoever connects transparency only with corruption and the freedom of information has failed to recognize its scope. Transparency is a systemic compulsion gripping all social processes and subjecting them to a deep-reaching change. Today’s social system submits all its processes to the demand for transparency in order to operationalize and accelerate them. Pressure for acceleration represents the corollary of dismantling negativity. Communication reaches its maximum velocity where like responds to like, when a chain reaction of likeness occurs. The negativity of alterity and foreignness—in other words, the resistance of the Other—disturbs and delays the smooth communication of the Same. Transparency stabilizes and speeds the system by eliminating the Other and the Alien...Clearly the human soul requires realms where it can be at home without the gaze of the Other. It claims a certain impermeability. Total illumination would scorch it and cause a particular kind of
spiritual burnout. Only machines are transparent... Trust is only possible in a state between knowing and not knowing.

        <rdfs:description>Reinterpretation of transparency that foregrounds the wider frame and contextual social factors that determine the meaning and effect of transparency practices.</rdfs:description>
        <rdfs:provocation>What does the work of transparency do?</rdfs:provocation>
        <rdfs:references>There&apos;s a need to distinguish between &quot;transparency as a verfiability and transparency as performativity&quot;.

“...The first approach understands transparency as the disclosure of information. Transparency as outlined in Section 2, with regard to its understanding in the GDPR and in the tradition of informed consent, aligns with this approach. Following this understanding, organizations and institutions are transparent when they release information about their internal practices, for example, their data collection and data analysis. In the context of AI, an example would be a shopping mall that announces at the entrance and on its website whether it uses facial recognition technology to track shoppers, rather than keeping this information hidden (Rieger, 2018). The second approach, however, looks at the tensions, struggles, and discourses inherent in transparency projects, and at unintended consequences and downsides of transparency. Following this approach, transparency should be understood more holistically, including the socio-material and ritualistic practices of organizations when they ‘‘perform’’ transparency. The performativity perspective understands transparency practices as social and organizational phenomena whose meaning goes substantially beyond the information conveyed. Similarly, technology compa nies such as Facebook or Google employ strong narra tives of openness, connectedness, and sharing on the user side while being highly secretive themselves (Van Dijck, 2013).

“In the information-based approach, the user is con ceptualized as an independent actor, who makes autonomous decisions on the basis of information made available to them through transparency. By contrast, the performativity account sees contextual social factors as considerably determining the meaning of transparency practices. We propose to bring insights from both perspectives together in a relational approach to transparency that draws on the concept of trustworthiness, where transparency is understood with regard to its relational function, as a signal of trustworthiness and willingness to be accountable to those affected by one’s actions or products.” (Felzmann et al., 2019). &quot;...Such rethinking requires acknowledging that transparency—the capacity to explain and understand decisions with reference to a‘universal’standard of rationality—is not the only basis for ethical action.Constructing common ground by enabling the possibility to arrive atshared understanding is still needed, but more often than not ethicalaction will need to start and be made in the conditions of opacity.That is to say, imperfect communication or even incommunicabilitybetween humans and algorithmic systems, humans and otherhumans, humans and their sociopolitical context. Starting fromopacity means that instead of aiming only for perfect understand-ability and transparency as safeguards for ethical action, one shouldespouse grounding ethics instead in situated, engaged and account-able action...&quot; (Smith et al., 2023).</rdfs:references>

The introduction of ‘impact’ as a significant criterion of research assessment and proposal evaluation has added yet another policy-driven, external requirement that academics are under pressure to meet. We have seen the number and range of different strategies that academics employ in order to navigate their way through this complex environment and still be able to conduct the research that is important to them, namely that which they feel is intrinsically worthwhile. Yet, inevitably, the priorities of government and funders are having some influence on the research that academics undertake.

        <rdfs:references>“...Unintended consequences” has come to mean unforeseen side effects, the study of which is often called the raison d’être of social science. However, this conceptual conflation has rendered invisible another category of outcomes, namely unintended but anticipated consequences. This category does not fit the classic dichotomy between “design” and “spontaneous growth” because unintended but anticipated consequences are neither designed nor generated spontaneously; they are better characterized as “permitted outcomes.”What makes reformers appear naïve, I would add, is the habit of using uanintended as a synonym for unanticipated, whereas in reality reformers must often make “difficult” choices—difficult precisely because they foresee unwelcome effects. Conflating “unintended” and “unanticipated” obscures this...&quot;...Why, then, does this conflation remain so pervasive? One reason is that all parties involved in the analysis of unintended consequences benefit from it. Rulers and policy reformers also benefit from conflating “unintended” and “unanticipated” consequences because it helps them to shed responsibility and avoid discussion about hurtful choices. The disentangling of unintended and unanticipated consequences foregrounds questions of justification and responsibility...&quot; (de Zwart, 2015)</rdfs:references>

This wondering remains a critically troubling question that entails unpacking what is actually done under the name of care, whatever good the intentions. Care is not only political, messy, and dirty; it is a trap for many and not less in technoscience. But asking how to care is an open wonder about the ethicopolitical significance of doings of care as immanent obligation. So while a critical stance can bring attention to such matters as who cares for whom, to what forms of care are prioritized at the expenses of others, a politics of speculative thinking also is a commitment to seek what other worlds could be in the making through caring while staying with the trouble of our own complicities and implications...&quot; (Bellacasa, 2017)</rdfs:references>

        <rdfs:references>&quot;Ontologies and identities are affected by collective politics and positionalities that constantly have to confront and put into question the boundaries and cuts given in existing worlds (e.g., the takenfor-granted “woman”). This way of thinking about creating other relations, other possibilities of existence—namely, other beings—is linked to concerns for the consequences of relations. What and how we enter in relations affects positions and relational ecologies. No longing here for fixed realities that could police the outcomes of encounters by confirming correspondence to preexisting “orders.” A relational way of thinking, which I call here “thinking-with,” creates new patterns out of previous multiplicities, intervening by adding layers of meaning rather than merely deconstructing or conforming to ready-made categories&quot; (Bellacasa, 2017).</rdfs:references>
